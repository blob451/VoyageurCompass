**Issue:** Complex analysis not triggering 70B model usage  
**Root Cause:** Model selection algorithm needs optimization  
**Impact:** Suboptimal analysis quality for detailed requests  
**Priority:** MEDIUM - Quality improvement opportunity

### 4. Response Metadata Inconsistency
**Issue:** Sentiment data not always included in responses  
**Root Cause:** Response formatting inconsistencies  
**Impact:** Client integration difficulties  
**Priority:** LOW - User experience enhancement

## Performance Optimization Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Phase 1 - Critical)
1. **Fix Ensemble Strategy Parsing**
   ```python
   # Current (broken)
   strategy = 'confidence_weighted'
   
   # Fixed
   strategy = EnsembleStrategy.CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTED
   ```

2. **Pre-load FinBERT Model at Startup**
   - Move model initialization to application startup
   - Implement singleton pattern for model instance
   - Expected improvement: 15-17s ‚Üí 2-3s total response time

### Performance Enhancements (Phase 2 - Optimization)
3. **Implement 70B Model Selection Logic**
   ```python
   def _select_optimal_model(self, detail_level, complexity_score):
       if detail_level == 'detailed' and complexity_score > 0.7:
           return 'llama3.1:70b'
       return 'llama3.1:8b'
   ```

4. **Async Sentiment Analysis**
   - Implement asynchronous processing for sentiment
   - Allow parallel sentiment and technical analysis
   - Cache sentiment results for recent news

5. **Enhanced Caching Strategy**
   - Implement sentiment-aware cache keys
   - Pre-warm cache for popular symbols
   - Dynamic TTL based on market volatility

### Advanced Optimizations (Phase 3 - Future)
6. **Model Quantization and Optimization**
   - 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency
   - ONNX runtime for faster inference
   - Model pruning for production deployment

7. **Distributed Processing**
   - Load balancing across multiple Ollama instances
   - GPU acceleration for concurrent requests
